I'm an undergrad student majoring in Computer Engineering.

I was born in Seoul and lived in Canada, Philippines, Hong Kong, and Lebanon.

I am currently focused on web development and also have great interest in A.I. and FinTech.

I will be updating some development related topics and translate trending tech topics to Korean.

Thanks.
