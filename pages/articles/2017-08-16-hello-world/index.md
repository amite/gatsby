<br/>

Hello World! I am very excited to create my first blog and blog post. I hope that I can post some of my thoughts as often as possible.

To briefly explain myself, I am a Computer Engineering student from Hong Kong University of Science & Technology.

I am quite new to programming and web development so I would like to share my experience and feeling as a newbie programmer.

I will also upload some posts about different trending topics in the tech industry.

I hope you guys enjoy my blog~

홍콩 과기대 재학 중인 초짜 프로그래머입니다.

처음 프로그램을 접하면서 제가 겪은 다양한 경험담을 공유할 것 같습니다.

주로 웹 개발 위주로 올릴 것 같고 가끔 가다 흥미로운 글 있으면 한글로 번역도 할 예정입니다.

감사합니다.
